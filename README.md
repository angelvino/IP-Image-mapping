Technologies used: HTML,CSS

Hello friends this is a image mapping website.
Here I have accomplished it with "Women Freedom Fighters of India".
When you click a image it will redirect you with a new webpage . In that new webpage it will show the clicked image bio-data 
Here i have uploaded all my files i have used. I have also included the live outcome of my project.

This is the final outome of my project.
